# Tron-light-game-2player

this game is made by me (AW) aka WHO, ive had no help fro others accept from some of my tutors and im very
grateful for them helping me in this small project.

full working game 
The Tron light cycles game (many free online versions on the web) involves a moving point with a constant 
speed that leaves a coloured trail wherever it has been.  At any time the point will be moving in one of the 
following directions UP,DOWN,LEFT or RIGHT (i.e. they can’t move diagonally).

Generally the game consists of two players, the objective being to cause your opponent to crash into your tail 
(or perhaps a wall).



HOW YOU COULD MAKE THIS BETTER??
-If a crash has occurred draw could (possibly) provide an explosion then 
restart the game – clear the screen and relocate players
-possibly instead of using a line why not create a motorbike by using ellipse and triangle
which could be more fun...
